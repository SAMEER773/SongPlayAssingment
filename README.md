This project is developed using Java as the programming language and TestNG framework for validating the logic. All the project dependencies are added in the pom.xml file.

To execute the program, you need to run the TestNG file. Here are the steps to do it in Eclipse IDE:

1. Right-click on the project.
2. Navigate to "Run As" and select "TestNG Suite".

After executing the TestNG suite, please follow the instructions displayed on the console.

In this project, TestNG assertions are used to verify the logic, and a listeners class is implemented to record the test results. The listeners class extends the report to record the results.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know.
